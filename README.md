# Lagoon_surge_model

This small python code should demonstrate how the box model is used in the manuscript
'How sea level rise hits you through the backdoor: amplification of storm surge levels in shallow coastal lagoons'
by Marvin Lorenz, Arne Arns & Ulf Graewe to study the effect of sea level rise on the tides, storm surges, freshwater pulses, and compound events in shallow coastal lagoons.

To run this code you need:
python3
numpy
matplotlib
cmocean
juypter notebook

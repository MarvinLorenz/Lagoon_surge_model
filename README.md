# Lagoon_surge_model

This small python code should demonstrate how the box model is used in the manuscript
'How sea level rise hits you through the backdoor: amplification of storm surge levels in shallow coastal lagoons'
by Marvin Lorenz, Arne Arns & Ulf Graewe to study the effect of sea level rise on the storm surge height in shallow
coastal lagoons.

To run this code you need:
python3
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
juypter notebook
